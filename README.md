Here’s a well-structured `README.md` file for your GitHub repository to showcase your face detection and blurring project:  


# Face Detection and Blurring in Python  
Protect privacy by detecting and blurring faces in **images**, **videos**, and **live webcam feeds** using Python! 🚀  

![Demo](/thumb.jpg)  

## 📜 Overview  
This project combines the power of **MediaPipe** for face detection and **OpenCV** for real-time image processing. With a few lines of code, you can:  
- Detect faces in images, videos, or live webcam feeds.  
- Blur the detected faces to anonymize them.  

### Key Features  
✔ **Privacy Protection**: Blur faces dynamically to protect identities.  
✔ **Real-Time Processing**: Efficient handling of webcam and video feeds.  
✔ **Modular Design**: Works seamlessly with images, videos, and live feeds.

## ⚙️ Installation  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Face-Blur-Python.git
   cd Face-Blur-Python
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:  
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python mediapipe argparse
   ```

3. (Optional) Install additional dependencies for video codecs:  
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python-headless
   ```

## 🚀 Usage  

### 1. Blur Faces in an Image  
```bash
python face_blur.py --mode image --filePath path/to/image.jpg
```

### 2. Blur Faces in a Video  
```bash
python face_blur.py --mode video --filePath path/to/video.mp4
```

### 3. Blur Faces in a Webcam Feed  
```bash
python face_blur.py --mode webcam
```

### Output  
- For images: Saves the blurred output as `output.png` in the `output_dir`.  
- For videos: Generates a processed video file named `output.mp4`.  
- For webcam: Displays the blurred feed live.

## 🛠 Code Structure  

- **`face_blur.py`**:  
   The main script that processes images, videos, or live webcam feeds to detect and blur faces.  
- **`requirements.txt`**:  
   Lists the dependencies for the project.

## 💡 How It Works  

1. **Face Detection**:  
   Utilizes **MediaPipe's Face Detection API** to detect faces in the input.  
2. **Blurring**:  
   Applies a Gaussian blur over the detected face regions using OpenCV's `cv2.blur`.  
3. **Modular Execution**:  
   Allows you to switch between image, video, and webcam modes via the `--mode` argument.
